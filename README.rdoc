= Rails Slugs

Inspired in friendly_id but more minimalistic

  gem 'rails-slugs', :git => 'git@github.com:mattways/rails-slugs.git'
  
Then bundle:
  $ bundle
  
= Usage

Just call slug method in your models...

If you want to make the slug the value of one field:
  slug :prop
  
To concatenate multiple the value of multiple fields:
  slug :prop1, :prop2, :prop3
  
If you need a very custom slug:
  slug proc { |record| "#{record.prop}-custom" }
